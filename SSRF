Right click the possbile post link - inspect 
In "NETWORK" section - delete the existing one and refresh or click the same link again
pause the Netwroking cliking on "PLAY"  botton
find the "POST" section - analyse the header and mainly "REQUEST" and "RESPONSE"
Right click the same "POST" link in "Network" and "EDIT and SEND"
In the "REQUEST" change possbile url name that is mentioned but not diplaying and "RESUME" the Networking and hit "SEND" and analyze the "RESPONSE" you will get the information
          in general : url=abc that you can change to url=def

but in real world scenario you can try:

        url=abc to url= file:///cat/etc
            or to url=http://localhost
            or to url= any other IPs, domain name or any other information you found there

OR in advance real world scenario level:
find the API IP and use the metadata or v1 
eg.
url = http://169.254.169.254/metadata or http://169.254.169.254/metadata/v1 and so on....

Within an AWS instance (like an EC2 virtual machine), the special link-local IP address 169.254.169.254 is used to access instance metadata and user data, but this is for internal communication within the AWS network only.
