For "GET" request generally you can modify on url browser itself so you can try direclty on browser

for "POST" request
Right click the possbile "POST" link - inspect or right click the page and Inspect
In "NETWORK" section - delete the existing one and refresh or click the same link again
pause the Netwroking cliking on "PLAY"  botton
find the "POST" section - analyse the header and mainly "REQUEST" and "RESPONSE"
Right click the same "POST" link in "Network" and "EDIT and SEND"
In the "REQUEST" change possbile url name that is mentioned but not diplaying and "RESUME" the Networking and hit "SEND" and analyze the "RESPONSE" you will get the information
          in general : url=abc that you can change to url=def

but in real world scenario you can try:

        url=abc to url= file:///cat/etc or  gopher://, and dict://
            or to url=http://localhost or url=http://localhost/config or admin
            or to url= any other IPs, domain name or any other information you found there

OR in advance real world scenario level:
find the API IP and use the metadata or v1 
eg.
url = http://169.254.169.254/metadata or http://169.254.169.254/metadata/v1 and so on....

What is SSRF?
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a web security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a server into making requests to unintended locations. This can allow access to internal services, leak sensitive data, or even interact with restricted networks.
More clearly: 
There is Main file or Database server which is serverA and web server ServerB. Now as a pentester you can't access the ServerA directly as it has hard security but in Web Server there is a chance of low level of scurity or ssrf vulnerability and has some loose security 
level between Web Server and ServerA to let web developer to access some extra data with less restriction. 

So as a pentester you will attack Webserver from where you will try to attack ServerA 

Types of SSRF
Regular SSRF — The attacker receives a direct response with data from the target.
Blind SSRF — The request is made, but no response is shown to the attacker.
Impact of SSRF
A successful SSRF attack can:

Access restricted internal systems.
Leak sensitive data like API keys and credentials.

Interact with internal networks.
Exploit cloud metadata services (e.g., AWS instance credentials).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example SSRF Attack
If a website allows fetching URLs, an attacker might trick it into accessing internal services:

GET /fetch?url=http://localhost/admin
This could expose internal admin pages.

In cloud environments, attackers might access metadata services:

GET /fetch?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
This can leak cloud instance credentials.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Prevent SSRF
Restrict allowed URLs — Only permit safe, predefined domains.
Block internal IP ranges — Prevent requests to 127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254, etc.
Disable unused protocols — Restrict file://, gopher://, and dict:// schemes.
Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) — Detect and block malicious requests.
Monitor logs and alerts — Detect unusual outbound requests.


Within an AWS instance (like an EC2 virtual machine), the special link-local IP address 169.254.169.254 is used to access instance metadata and user data, but this is for internal communication within the AWS network only.
