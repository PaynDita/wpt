The Juicy Potato exploit works by abusing Windows' Event Log service and COM object handling to escalate privileges from low-level users to SYSTEM level. It is highly effective on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019 and works by tricking Windows into executing malicious code with elevated privileges, leveraging the SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege. While it is an effective exploit, mitigation involves patching, privilege restrictions, and robust monitoring.
