Cadaver is a command-line tool used to interact with WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) servers.

Think of it like FTP, but for WebDAV, which is a protocol for managing files over the web.



Basic Usage
cadaver https://your.webdav.server/

put /path/for/your/webshell

curl -u "user:pass" {URL/webdav/shell}


Then you'll get an interactive prompt (like FTP), where you can:

Command	Description
ls	List files
cd	Change directory
get	Download a file
put	Upload a file
mget	Download multiple files
mput	Upload multiple files
mkdir	Make a directory
rm	Remove a file
bye	Exit
